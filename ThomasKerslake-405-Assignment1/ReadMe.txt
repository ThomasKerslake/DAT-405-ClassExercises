** READ ME FILE **
- Within this file you can find out how to use the application and other general information.


** WHAT IS THIS PROJECT? **
-This project is all about creative coding. This is using code to create / generate live artwork.


** THE DEVELOPMENT **
-This project has been being developed for around about 3 weeks and has been through a few iterations before
coming to this point in the projects life. After starting with a few quick sketches and practicing with examples 
and lecture exercises, I moved onto making an initial designs for both of my ideas. From this point I stuck 
with the one design of using lines. The project started out with creating a class for my line, this class would 
hold attributes and methods to how the lines would work (move) and appear on the screen. I then added an array so that I 
could have the array hold the values for each of my lines. From there I added interactions that a user could then 
use to change how the project appears. 


** HOW TO USE THIS DIRECTORY **
-The Images-Of-Project folder holds randomly generated images of what the project has produced.
-The Project folder holds the actual project
-The ThomasKerslake-405-Report holds my report for this project.


** HOW IT WORKS **
-Bellow is listed all of the actions / interactions you can perform on the page.

Use the  (Up Arrow) to increase the speed of the lines.
Use the  (Left Arrow) to invert the direction of the lines.
Use the  (Down Arrow) to reset the speed of the lines to a base 'regular' value.
Use the  (Right Arrow) while your mouse is over the canvas to delete all of the previously drawn lines.
Use the  /  (Left and Down Arrow) one after the other to create a new effect.
